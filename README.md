# Dissertation-MSc-CAM

The code is to implement the figures and numerical experiments in the dissertation.

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that allow the user to generate results and/or plot the results in the paper. ``Ad2L_steep``, ``Ad2L_noise`` and ``BLR`` correspond to the three experiments in the Numerical Experiment section. ``toymodel_AdL`` includes additional images, as well as sampling procedures for some simple potentials.

Note that all the code are implemented with Julia/1.9.0, and these numerical simulations were run on the Edinburgh Compute and Data Facility (ECDF) computing cluster. However, it is still possible to reproduce lower quality results by reducing the number of samples. Please see the Edinburgh Computing and Data Facility website.
